I understand this authorization does not cover major surgery unless the medical opinions of one other physician or dentist, concurring in the necessity for such surgery, are obtained prior to the performance of surgery. I agree to be responsible for any expenses incurred for such treatment. YWC insurance does not cover illness (such as cold symptoms, stomach aches, etc.) or pre-existing conditions. Participants and their parents will be responsible for any costs associated with treatment in event of an emergency. This consent is valid from June 14, 2010 to June 18, 2010
<br />
Each participant is included in a YWC limited coverage ($100,000 maximum benefit) accident insurance policy while they are under the Immediate approved direction and supervision of YWC. I understand that if my daughter leaves the required supervision of her counselor and/or staff without permission or leaves campus after hours or without permission, she will not be covered by the YWC insurance.
<br />
I understand that participants will be sent home if any drugs, alcohol, or cigarettes are found in their possession or use during the week. Young Women's Conference reserves the right to ensure the safety and well being of all participants and will dismiss a participant for misconduct or unsociable behavior as determined by the Directors. Fighting, stealing, shoplifting, possessing any harmful weapons, leaving campus unsupervised, leaving the dorms after curfew, and deliberately damaging university or program property are grounds for being sent home early. Anyone being sent home will be responsible for all transportation costs and registration fees will not be refunded.</td>
